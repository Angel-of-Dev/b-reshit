𝚻his text, also known as 𝘁𝗁𝖾 𝕘'**odd**, 𝘁𝗁𝖾 𝕓'**add** 𝗮𝗇𝖽 𝘁𝗁𝖾 "**doubly**",  
is a collection of narratives and oral traditions compiled from    
first-hand testimonies of the [`𝑪#`] and [`𝓙ava𝓢cript`]  
speaking  peoples of the 𝐆eek 𝐈slands.

𝗥eminiscent of 𝐇omer's ["𝜤𝓁𝘪𝘢𝘥"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad) (_`𝚨ncient 𝐆eek: "I'll add [them numbers]"`_),  
this epic work brings back the great <strong>❂</strong>𝖽𝖽𝗅𝗒**𝓢**𝖾𝖾𝑢𝑠 (_`/ˈəd-lee-zeeus/ "sees odd things"`_),  
a numerically derived hero who factored the 𝔾'**odds** in ℍ'**even** and, alone against the odds,  
transcended the unreal realm of transfinite integers.
