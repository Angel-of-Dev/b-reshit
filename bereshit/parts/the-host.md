## The Host

I am of people from a heavily contested region,   
who still remain after centuries of oppression from:

We are [Proto-Indo-Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans) => [Veneti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula_Veneti) => [Slavs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs)

Most of my cohort were from poor or just-about-managing communities stunned from years of stagnant wages and extreme inflation peaking at 600% during our formative years.

Growing around adults scared of "inflated numbers" helped me develop panic attacks caused by large integers.

Our parents had us before they [`"figured it out"`], so we watched them [`"figure it out"`] in real-time.

They grew up in a puppet state, around adults broken from the post-war reality, secret police,
distrust and widespread practice of self-medication through alcoholism.

[This Be The Universe](#this-be-the-universe), and so we acquired their negative self-talk, lack of trust, secrecy and fears.

This is the right time to thank my parents for literally everything good that happened during my childhood.

— [`Thank you. I love you.`] —

My primary school was a Nazi concentration camp in the 1940s, then a Soviet NKVD prison for [Lemkos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemkos) and [Ukrainian Insurgent Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army).

[`We were taught to enjoy reading`]

I ["prevailed over Dune"](https://archive.org/details/frank-herberts-dune-saga-collection-books-1-6-by-frank-herbert/page/n17/mode/2up?q=most+delicate) but failed at Bruce Eckel's [Thinking in C++](https://web.mit.edu/merolish/ticpp/Frames.html),
pages of which even today are cockled and wrapped from tears that I cried when my young [ego died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death), humiliated and defeated by words on paper.

It took many more attempts over many months to conquer [that beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self), hours upon hours of pain every day.
Reading, re-reading, through tears and through pain, over and over and over again. It gave me headaches, it made me cry, I had panic attacks and I wanted to die.

Then one day, tired from whinging like a wuss,  
I "[clicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)" and began **[`Thinking in "SEE PLUS PLUS"`]**

```c++
#include <iostream> 
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

/**
 * Think in C++.
 *
 * Frames of the [ Stream of Thoughts ] flow through the thinker's mind
 * and present themeselves back through
 * the [ Standard Consciousness Output ] (std::cout).
 *
 * @param argc Non-negative value representing the number of frames.
 * @param argv Pointer to the first element of an array of pointers, 
 *             of which the last one is null and the previous ones,
 *             if any, point to null-terminated multibyte strings.  
 *             These strings shall constitute the frames
 *             of the [ Stream of Thoughts ].
 * @param envp Pointer to the first element of an array of pointers, 
 *             of which the last one is null and the previous ones,
 *             if any, point to null-terminated multibyte strings.
 *             These strings shall constitute 
 *             the environment.
 * @return zero when everything is fine.
