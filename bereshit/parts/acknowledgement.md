## Acknowledgement

A world-wide tsunami of techno-progress gave rise to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [The Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) and [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Risks_and_harm).  

This is a tiny slice of change during [`work filled existence`] of my [`brain host`]:

The world that we know keeps rewriting itself. **And so must You**.  

### Change ~~Duality~~ Trinity

All change is like [Azrael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael) himself,  
terrifying [`Angel of Death`] to some and long awaited [`Help from God`] to others. 

So which one is it?  

Perhaps this [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) needs a new messenger, one with name only hinting at change-induced anxiety, while focusing on opportunity to rethink previously held believes and to rewrite old stories in a language of a new reality - **[`Angel of Dev`]**.

After all, re-think and re-write is what [devs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) who live to deliver the change do.
