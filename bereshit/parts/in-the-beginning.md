**The first word** of **[`The Bible`]**,  
both the [`Jewish Torah`] and the [`Christian New Testament`], typically translated as **[`"In the beginning..."`]**,  
referring to [Genesis 1:1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_1:1).

[Azrael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael) by [HVOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsBGIhaRBoc) [`Her Voice Over Boys`]  
Muzzles my thoughts that in a violent stream    
Invade with their noise   
To perturb my dream.

As I lay on soft moss my ego falls in,  
In all the directions [`you know what I mean`].

Connected through void to the world in a spin,  
Grotesque in their form [metamorphoses](/refs/#ref-metamorphoses) begin.

Then violent [`"TURN BACK!"`] - hypnagogic spasm!

Pulled back to my body in schism filled with dread,  
I think of connection that sparked in my head:

> [`angel-of-death`] sounds like **[`angel-of-dev`]**!
