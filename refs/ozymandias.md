> I met a traveller from an antique land  
> Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,  
> Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:  
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> "My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
>
> **Nothing beside remains**.  
> **Boundless and bare sands stretch far away**.
