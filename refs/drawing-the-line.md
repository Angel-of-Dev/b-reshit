### Bright Line

A clearly defined set of objective rules leaving no room for unambiguity or subjective interpretations.

### Fine Line

A clearly defined set of objective rules interpreted through a balancing lens of weight factors.  
Allows a more flexible application than a **bright line** but needs additional guidelines for factor weight selection.  

[`bright line`] [`+`] [`weight factors`] [`=>`] [`fine line`]

Misguided selection of weights risks **line blurring** that reduces objectivity and promotes inconsistent application.

### Blurred Line

A degenerate set of rules open to subjective interpretations.
