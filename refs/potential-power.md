> _"leaders have powers only potentially available to them"_

**Structures of leadership naturally assume high importance** in all organisations.

Leaders must impose upon themselves rules of [`civil and mutually respectful behavior`] and acknowledge with [`integrity and certitude`] that their words and actions have long lasting impact on the whole organisation and its ecosystem.

**Leaders have obligation** to transmit only those ideas which focus attention of the whole organization on **goals that bring long term benefit to its people and to its ecosystem**.

---

A **healthy leadership structure** is characterised by:
* [`low aversion to change`] of leaders who do not deliver their promise.
* [`civil and mutually respectful`] leadership changes at all levels.
* leaders who seek and maintain [`healthy collaboration`] with all their peers.

---

A **healthy collaboration practice**:
* is built on [`robust relationships`].
* [`do not degrade`] before, during, and after leadership change.
* continuously [`seeks to improve`].

---

A **robust relationship** is:
* built on [`dialogue and consensus`].
* civil, mutually respectful and [`mutually beneficial`].
* [`not impacted by relative positions`] in structures of any social or natural hierarchy.
