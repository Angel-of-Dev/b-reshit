::: info OPERA APERTA

**Opera Aperta** is a term understood as **"a plurality of meanings"**. More specifically, it suggests that there is not just one final meaning of a text or other forms of expression.

Instead, [`the interpretation always depends on past experiences, prior knowledge, amount of attention given or current mood of the interpreter`], among many other factors. 

In a broader sense this applies to all forms of information, not limited to art.
