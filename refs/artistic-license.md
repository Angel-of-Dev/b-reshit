Being a science fiction novel, [Frank Herbert's "Dune"](https://archive.org/details/frank-herberts-dune-saga-collection-books-1-6-by-frank-herbert/page/n17/mode/2up?q=most+delicate) provides only enough detail of its world to drive the story forward, leaving plenty to reader's imagination.

Similarly, this narrative draws enough inspiration from Dune's world to keep going without a burden of absolute compatibility with the original story or any other book in the series.
