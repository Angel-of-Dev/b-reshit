**Your brain naturally seeks** **[**`to separate`**] [**`tools and objects`**] [**`from`**] [**`the living beings`**]**.

Your tend to see **inanimate objects** in terms of their **utility**.  
Your tend to see **animate beings** in terms of their **intentional stance**.

**You do it all the time!**

> _"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do."_

**We are wired for real-time use of physical stance**. We are quick to evaluate utility of objects and tools. We spot their strengths and weaknesses with high precision and efficiency, and we use that knowledge to improve our tools.
This natural process of continuous evaluation and improvement of tools consumes relatively few resources (attention, energy) to produce relatively high yield (productivity, automation).

**Intentional stance is a slower, more complex process** allowing us to plan interactions and predict their outcomes, cooperate and bond.
It comes equipped with clemency and fault tolerance improving chances of damaged social bonds to recover with time, making us socially robust animals.
This higher-level process consumes relatively more resources of more types (attention, energy, complex internal representations, regulation of emotions) to construct and maintain robust social ecosystems that improve long-term outcomes of the spiecies.
