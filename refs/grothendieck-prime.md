You might have heard of **Alexander Grothendieck**,  
perhaps the greatest mathematician of XX century who worked on uses of **$L^p$ spaces** that play fundamental role in methods applied in **Machine Learning** and **AI**.

#### Lapsus Linguae / Slip Of The Tongue

He also once said that number $57$ is prime  (it is not: $3 \cdot 19$),  
so now we honour him by calling it a "Grothendieck Prime" even though it probably never happened, but still, it is a good story.
