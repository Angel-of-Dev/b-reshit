::: info DUNE - THE BEGINNING

> _The [**!i**teral] beginning of Frank Herbert's Dune_

_A beginning is the **TIME FOR TAKING THE MOST DELICATE CARE** that the balances are correct.  
This **EVERY SISTER** of the Bene Gesserit knows.  
To **BEGIN YOUR STUDY** of the life of Muad’Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: 
born in the [`Grothendieck Prime`](#ref-grothendieck-prime) year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV.  
And **TAKE THE MOST SPECIAL** care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis.  
Do not be deceived **BY THE FACT THAT HE WAS BORN** on Caladan and lived his first years there.  
Arrakis, **THIS PLANET** known as Dune, **IS FOREVER OURS**._
