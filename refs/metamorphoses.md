**Franz Kafka** alludes to [`"Metamorphoses"`]  
throughout [`"The Metamorphosis"`]  
speaking of [`transformations`]  
at the heart [`translations`]  
of both texts.

This technique creates a type of **"entanglement of meaning"**, a text that might be interpreted differently by different readers, depending on the reading order, time between reads, other books read in between etc.  

Knowing both texts allows the reader to consider the ways in which they relate to each other, giving additional depth and enabling new interpretations.
