*"A leader must learn to persuade and not to compel.  
He must lay [the best coffee hearth](#dune-01) to attract the finest men."*

::: tip 🔰 Lore
A sound advice given to [Paul Atreides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Atreides) in the opening act of Frank Herbert's Dune.  
Some say that those words marked the beginning of **The Hearth of Dune Company** that quickly seeded the whole planet Arrakis (known as Dune) with a network of mechanical brewers 
bringing the best [spice coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/tcw924/i_made_as_best_i_could_dune_spice_coffee/) to the whole [Fremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremen) population.

## :mag_right: What Even Is This? 

This is a series of articles and code exploring:


* 🧬 evolution of artificial organisms
* 🧫 biology
* 🪐 physics
* 🧮 mathematics

peppered with a [hint of spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melange_(fictional_drug)) and narrative inspired by [Frank Herbert's "Dune"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)).

::: tip Artistic License
Being a science fiction novel, "Dune" provides only enough detail of its world to drive the story forward, leaving plenty to reader's imagination.  

Similarly, narrative of this series draws enough inspiration from Dune's world to keep going without a burden of absolute compatibility with the original story or any other book in the series.

## The Story
![](planet.png){style=float:right;margin-top:0px;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px;width:220px}

**Water** is hard to find on a dry surface of the planet, but luckily **"wind trapping"** technology can reclaim some of the ambient moisture, 
usually by cooling air below its [dew point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point). 

[The Spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melange_(fictional_drug)) (☣️) is sourced from the [Fremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremen) (🥷) who live in communities called **sietches** (🕋️️) and that's where
**The Hearth of Dune Company (🍁THC)** deployed its first brewer.

### [Hearth of Stilgar](#dune-03)

The brewer is a small device hosting **Klepshydra** (_lit. "water thief"_), a delicate plant (🌱) with sweet flowers (🌺) and unmatched ability to extract water (💧) from its environment.

**Solar Panels** (🔷️) produce power for the brewer and charge the **Batteries** (🪫).
The surplus of stored energy is used by Fremen to power tools through the **Power Bit** (🔌).

Called **"Heart of Steel"** by Fremen, this **_desert flower_** opens up at night letting in the moisture from cooled air. 

Then, like a **_fist of steel_** it clenches prompted by the first ray of daylight, isolating the plant now safe but trapped inside.

Only small patch of exposed sand connects plant with the sunny world outside.  
This _"vent"_ designed to prevent buildup of toxic gases rooted itself deep in traditions of desert peoples as **Atash Kadeh** (♨️),
a _"fire goblet"_ central to the **coffee drinking culture** and a _brewing ground_ for newly evolved organisms (⚕️) that we are about to study.
