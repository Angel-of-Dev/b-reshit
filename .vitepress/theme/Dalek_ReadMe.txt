DALEK is a distressed, small caps typeface based on the lettering used in the Dalek Book of 1964 and in the Daleks strip in TV21 comic. The fonts have overtones of Greek, Phoenician and Runic alphabets.

In addition to the original regular font, Heavy and Light weights are available, and each weight is now supplied with a new Italic (optically corrected oblique). The fonts contain a full complement of Latin Extended-A characters, and K-Type downloads also include Greek capitals/small caps.

Check out Dalek Pinpoint, a clean and precise version of the Dalek typeface.
